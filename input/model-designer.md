The Model Designer implements the FHIR StructureDefinition specification, which prescribes rules for logical data models, FHIR resources, profiles, and their elements and data types. With the Model Designer, you can create and manage informational data models through a user-friendly interface. Alternatively, you can use FHIR StructureDefinition JSON or FSH notations. The model designer capabilities allow you to import/export models and define attributes, data types, cardinality, and terminology binding, among other features.
