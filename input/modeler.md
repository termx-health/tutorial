Modeler is a module consisting of a informational model designer and a transformation designer.

### Model Designer
The model designer allows you to create and modify data models, both logical and FHIR profiles.
The model designer implements [FHIR StructureDefinition](http://hl7.org/fhir/structuredefinition.html) and supports 3 types of information input - JSON, FSH and user-friendly graphical UI.

### Transformations

Transformations are used to transform data from one model to another.
TermX offers implementation of [FHIR StructureMap](http://hl7.org/fhir/structuremap.html) based on [FHIR Mapping Language](http://hl7.org/fhir/mapping-language.html).
