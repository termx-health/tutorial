The objective of the visual editor is to conceal the complexity of the FML language and facilitate rapid adaptation to it.
The graphical FML Editor incorporates the following patterns:
- Handling of any structures and data types defined in FHIR StructureDefinition format.
- Capability to create subgroups (encapsulating rules within isolated spaces).
- Capability to use FML transformers - constants and functions.
- Support for the FHIRPath language through the FML function ”evaluate”.
- Support of conditional ”when” expressions.
- Specialized support for complex data types such as Coding, Quantity, Date, and Reference.

The figure demonstrates the example of transforming the logical model to the Observation resource.
