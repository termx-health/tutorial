#### Translations: task flow

Every translation of SNOMED concept create a **concept review** task.

The task number and status is visible in the SNOMED CT browser and in the [task management software](page:task-management).

Translation task contains information about conceptID, existing designations, new translation and working or daily build branch where it will be added. The user may use the context links to switch between task and SNOMED CT browser.

Task status change impacts futher behaviour: 
- 'accepted' -> concept translations will be added to connected snomed branch
- in other cases history of proposed translation will remain, but this translation will not appear in snomed server


#### Translations: language module

Configuration of language modules is defined using Code System 'snomed-module'. To add a new language module you have to add a new concept.
- concept code: language code
- concept desugnation 'display': language module name (will be shown in modules selection)
- concept property 'language': language of module
- concept property 'refsetId': snomed id of language refset
- concept property 'moduleId': snomed id of language module
